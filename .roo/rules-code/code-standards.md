# Code Standards

- Imports must be separated by new line
  - first all standard packages
  - then external dependencies
  - finally imports from the current project
- Try to maintain 80% of unit test coverage, unless the complexity to reach that level is too high, in this case ask the user for instructions
- All public interfaces, structs, methods and attributes must have a comment explaining it's intent and usage examples, when applicable
